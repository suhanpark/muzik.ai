## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

- Google Cloud Platform account
- Python 3.7+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/suhanpark/muzik.ai.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd muzik.ai`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Configuration:**

1. Set up Google Cloud Storage buckets for your data and models.
2. Update the configuration files in the `data_pipeline` and `model` directories with your GCP credentials and bucket information.

**Running the Pipeline:**

1. **Data Ingestion:** `python data_pipeline/data_ingestion.py`
2. **Data Preprocessing:** `python data_pipeline/data_preprocessing.py`
3. **Model Training:** `python model/train.py`
4. **Music Generation:** `python model/generate.py`

**Note:** This project is currently under active development. I'm continuously working on enhancing the MLOps pipeline and expanding the capabilities of our music generation system.

## Future Directions

- **Real-time Music Generation:** Implement a system for generating music in real-time, potentially integrating with live performance setups.
- **User-Controlled Parameters:** Allow users to specify desired musical attributes, such as genre, mood, and instrumentation, to guide the generation process.
- **Model Optimization:** Explore techniques for optimizing model size and inference speed to enable deployment on resource-constrained devices.
